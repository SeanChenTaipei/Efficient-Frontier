## Introduction

The efficient frontier is a concept in modern portfolio theory that represents a set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk or the lowest risk for a given expected return. Mean-variance optimization is a popular technique used to find an efficient portfolio that maximizes returns for a given level of risk or minimizes risk for a given level of returns. This repository provides an implementation of these techniques, enabling users to construct efficient portfolios based on their specific risk-return preferences.

## Files

The repository consists of the following files:

1. **MVO.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook file demonstrates the construction of the efficient frontier using historical asset returns. It provides an example of how to find optimal portfolios along the efficient frontier based on different risk levels or expected returns.

2. **MeanVarianceOptimization.py**: This Python file contains the implementation of the mean-variance optimization algorithm. It includes functions for calculating portfolio returns, volatility, and weights based on user-defined inputs.

3. **data.csv**: This CSV file contains historical asset price data used for calculating returns and constructing the efficient frontier. Modify this file or replace it with your own data as needed.
